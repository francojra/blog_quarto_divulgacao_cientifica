Hi, my name is Jeanne Franco! I have a degree in Ecology, a master's degree in Forestry Sciences and a PhD in Ecology from the [Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte](https://www.ufrn.br/). During my undergraduate studies, I researched how herbaceous vegetation in degraded areas affects the growth of seedlings of tree species native to the Caatinga and how it contributes to the invasion of an exotic species. During my master's degree, I carried out field research evaluating the natural regeneration of tree species in a degraded mangrove area. During my doctorate, I did research on restoration ecology, biodiversity and identification of herbaceous species in the BrazilDry experiment, which belongs to the largest network of biodiversity experiments in the world called TreeDivNet.

Currently, I am a data analyst at the company [Beta Analítica](https://betaanalitica.com.br/) and I am also an organizer of the [R-Ladies de Natal](https://rladies.org/) community, a non-profit organization whose mission is to promote gender diversity and training in the R language. I am enthusiastic about using R for data science with experience in producing graphs, producing maps and basic and advanced statistical analysis.

I am interested in several areas of knowledge, including psychology, social sciences, environment and neurosciences. Therefore, I decided to create this blog to disseminate high-impact scientific articles and contributions. I hope you enjoy reading and gain good knowledge.
